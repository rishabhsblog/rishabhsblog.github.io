title: Hello World!

Hello there! 

I'm currently a rising junior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon. Outside of school, I am involved in CMU's undergraduate underwater robotics team, TartanAUV, where we compete 
in the annual international RoboSub competition. 

I've created this blog for documenting and sharing the projects I work on this summer. This past week, I have been working on augmenting a RC car with a Raspberry Pi and a camera. With the Raspberry Pi running ROS (Robot Operating System) I want to experiment adding navigation functionalities starting with something simple as following a colored object and moving to more advanced autnomous procedures. Ideally, I would have a stronger embedded computer (maybe a Jetson Nano), however, due to the lockdown, I only have access to the Pi. 

My goal is to post on (at least) a weekly basis with project updates along the summer. The next post will go over the RC car conversion and brief overview of the software infrastructure. Till then, feel free to check out the Github [repo](https://github.com/rishabhkjain/self-driving-car) for more details.
